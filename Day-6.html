       Once you have mastered the use of topic sentences, 
       you may decide that the topic sentence for a particular 
       paragraph really shouldn’t be the first sentence of the paragraph.
        This is fine—the topic sentence can actually go at the beginning,
         middle, or end of a paragraph; whats important is that it is in
          there somewhere so that readers know what the main idea of the
           paragraph is and how it relates back to the thesis of your paper. 
           Suppose that we wanted to start the piranha paragraph with a transition
             bold:
</div>
<!-- Border ,padding,padding shorthand,margin-->
<div>
 Although most people consider piranhas to be quite dangerous, 
 they are, for the most part, entirely harmless. Piranhas
  rarely feed on large animals; they eat smaller fish and aquatic plants. 
  When confronted with humans, piranhas first instinct is to flee,
   not attack. Their fear of humans makes sense. Far more piranhas 
   are eaten by people than people are eaten by piranhas. 
   If the fish are well-fed, they wont bite humans.

    <h1> Like sharks, snakes, and spiders, piranhas are widely feared.
         Although most people consider piranhas to be quite dangerous,

           sense.
                  are afraid of, like sharks, snakes, and spiders.
                   Our paragraph might look like this (the topic sentence is bold):
                   Like sharks, snakes, and spiders,
                   piranhas are widely feared.</h1>
